Al-Murassant air base is a small military airport located in Rutbah District, western Iraq, 70 kilometers east of the al-Waleed border crossing near Syria. The airbase used to be run by Iraqi Air Forces until it went out of service following the 2003 American invasion of Iraq. In 2014 ISIS took control of the area, with Iraqi forces freeing the airbase in 2017. The popular mobilization made the airbase their main camp in the Anbar Governorate. ==References== Category:Al Anbar Governorate Category:Airports in Iraq Category:Iraqi Air Force bases
