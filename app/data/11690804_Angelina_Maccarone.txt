In that same year, she wrote a screenplay treatment that won the award of the Hamburg Department of Culture, which marked the beginning of her career in film- making.

It is about a gay Muslim woman fleeing from Iran to seek asylum in Germany, and it takes on topics regarding unclear and changing representations of identity as a lesbian Muslim woman.
