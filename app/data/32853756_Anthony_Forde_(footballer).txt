Anthony Michael Forde (born 16 November 1993) is an Irish professional footballer who plays for Wrexham. He has represented the Republic of Ireland at numerous youth levels. ==Career== ===Wolves=== Forde moved to Wolves in summer 2009 to become part of their academy group. He made his senior debut on 23 August 2011 as a substitute in a League Cup tie against Northampton Town, and his Premier League debut on 26 November 2011 at Chelsea. He made six appearances in the top flight as the club suffered relegation. Having signed a contract to last until summer 2015, the winger started the first two games of new Wolves' manager Ståle Solbakken but gradually faded from the first team as the season progressed. In March 2013 he moved on loan to League One side Scunthorpe United for the remainder of the 2012–13 season. During the 2013–14 season, Forde made only five appearances (four as substitute) as Wolves won promotion back to the Championship at the first attempt. ===Walsall=== On 12 August 2014, Forde joined Wolves' Midlands neighbours Walsall of League One, signing a two-year deal for an undisclosed fee. He scored his first goal for the club in a 3–0 victory over Doncaster Rovers on 27 September 2014. Forde scored a free kick in the Saddlers' 2–0 victory over Preston North End in the first leg of the Football League Trophy Northern area final on 7 January 2015. He scored his second league goal of the season on 17 January 2015 in a 2–0 win over Colchester. ===Rotherham United=== On 30 June 2016, it was announced that Forde had opted to join Rotherham United on a three-year-deal for an undisclosed fee.
