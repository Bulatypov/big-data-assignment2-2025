Ayn Ruymen (born July 18, 1947) is an American former actress and theater director.

After relocating to Los Angeles, Ruymen made her feature film debut in Paul Bartel's horror film Private Parts (1972) and appeared in several television films during the 1970s. She had a lead role on the sitcom The McLean Stevenson Show from 1976 to 1977. She made her last screen appearance in the television film Firestorm: 72 Hours in Oakland (1993).

In 1969, Ruymen appeared as a model at the Miami International Boat Show to promote Sungard sunscreen, covering half her face in it before spending time in the sun, demonstrating the product's efficacy at preventing sunburns. ==Career== In 1970, she was cast as Polly Meara in a Broadway production of Neil Simon's The Gingerbread Lady opposite Maureen Stapleton, which ran between December 1970 and 1971. Critic George Oppenheimer praised Ruymen for "showing great promise" in the "difficult" role. For her performance, she won the Theatre World Award in 1971. During her stage career, she became a member of Actors' Equity. Ruymen subsequently relocated to Los Angeles in late 1971 to pursue a film career. She commented that she initially disliked California: "I found the Sunset Strip disgusting. I was trying to get work and nothing happened for six months. It makes you want to pull your hair out." In early 1972, she was cast in an episode of the medical drama series Medical Center. She was subsequently cast in the lead role of Paul Bartel's horror film Private Parts (1972), playing a young woman who uncovers dark secrets in a Los Angeles hotel operated by her aunt.
